We introduce the notion of adjustment pair and present complete graphical conditions for identifying causal effects by adjustment. We further design an algorithm for listing all admissible adjustment pairs in polynomial delay, which is useful for researchers interested in evaluating certain properties of some admissible pairs but not all (common properties include cost, variance, and feasibility to measure).

@article{Egami2018,
	abstract = {Social and biomedical scientists are often interested in generalizing the average treat- ment effect (ATE) estimated in a randomized experiment to a non-experimental target population. Many existing approaches require observing a set of variables accounting for selection into the experiment (a sampling set) in the target population as well as in the experimental sample. To relax this strict data requirement, we propose a data- driven method to estimate a separating set – a set of variables affecting both the sampling mechanism and treatment effect heterogeneity. Our approach has two advantages. First, our algorithm only requires that a sampling set be observed in the experimental data, not in the target population. As long as researchers can collect a rich set of covariates on the experimental sample, the proposed method can select a separating set sufficient for identifying the population ATE. Second, we can incorporate researcher-specific data constraints. When scholars know certain variables are unmeasurable in the target pop- ulation, our method can select a separating set subject to such constraints. We validate our proposed method using naturalistic simulations based on real-world data.},

Main Outcome Measures: Whole-brain volume ad- justed for head size (aWBV) and change per year. Results: aWBV declined by 0.22{\%} per year between the ages of 20 and 80 years with accelerated decline in ad- vanced aging. Controlling for effects of age and sex in older adults (65 years) withCDR0, higher SES was as- sociated with smaller aWBV (3.8{\%} difference spanning the sample range from middle to high privilege, P.01) and more rapid volume loss (0.39{\%} per year to 0.68{\%} per year from middle to high privilege, P.05). aWBV was reduced by 2.5{\%} in individuals positive for PiB bind- ing (n=9) as compared with individuals negative for PiB binding (n=49, P.05), supporting an influence of un- detected preclinical AD. Follow-up clinical data re- vealed that brain volume reduction associated with SES was greater in those who later developed very mild de- mentia (preclinicalCDR0 group, n=19) compared with those who remained nondemented (stableCDR0 group, n=64; groupSES interaction, P.05).

We describe examples of selection bias in case-control studies (eg, inappropriate selection of controls) and cohort studies (eg, informative censoring). We argue that the causal structure underlying the bias in each example is essentially the same: conditioning on a common effect of 2 variables, one of which is either exposure or a cause of exposure and the other is either the outcome or a cause of the outcome. This structure is shared by other biases (eg, adjustment for variables affected by prior exposure). A structural classification of bias distinguishes between biases resulting from conditioning on common effects ("selection bias") and those resulting from the existence of common causes of exposure and outcome ("confounding"). This classification also leads to a unified approach to adjust for selection bias.},

We generated city-level and census-tract-level prevalence estimates of 27 measures for the 500 largest US cities.METHODS: To validate the methodology, we constructed multilevel logistic regressions to predict 10 selected health indicators among adults aged 18 years or older by using 2013 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data; we applied their predicted probabilities to census population data to generate city-level, neighborhood-level, and zip-code-level estimates for the city of Boston, Massachusetts.RESULTS: By comparing the predicted estimates with their corresponding direct estimates from a locally administered survey (Boston BRFSS 2010 and 2013), we found that our model-based estimates for most of the selected health indicators at the city level were close to the direct estimates from the local survey. We also found strong correlation between the model-based estimates and direct survey estimates at neighborhood and zip code levels for most indicators.CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that our model-based estimates are reliable and valid at the city level for certain health outcomes. Local health authorities can use the neighborhood-level estimates if high quality local health survey data are not otherwise available.},

	abstract = {We develop fast algorithms for estimation of generalized linear models with convex penalties. The models include linear regression, two-class logistic regression, and multi- nomial regression problems while the penalties include l1 (the lasso), l2 (ridge regression) and mixtures of the two (the elastic net). The algorithms use cyclical coordinate descent, computed along a regularization path. The methods can handle large problems and can also deal efficiently with sparse features. In comparative timings we find that the new algorithms are considerably faster than competing methods.},

	abstract = {Medical imaging has enormous potential for early disease prediction, but is impeded by the difficulty and expense of acquiring data sets before symptom onset. UK Biobank aims to address this problem directly by acquiring high-quality, consistently acquired imaging data from 100,000 predominantly healthy participants, with health outcomes being tracked over the coming decades. The brain imaging includes structural, diffusion and functional modalities. Along with body and cardiac imaging, genetics, lifestyle measures, biological phenotyping and health records, this imaging is expected to enable discovery of imaging markers of a broad range of diseases at their earliest stages, as well as provide unique insight into disease mechanisms. We describe UK Biobank brain imaging and present results derived from the first 5,000 participants' data release. Although this covers just 5{\%} of the ultimate cohort, it has already yielded a rich range of associations between brain imaging and other measures collected by UK Biobank.},

	abstract = {Despite calls to incorporate population science into neuroimaging research, most studies recruit small, non-representative samples. Here, we examine whether sample composition influences age-related variation in global measurements of gray matter volume, thickness, and surface area. We apply sample weights to structural brain imaging data from a community-based sample of children aged 3–18 (N = 1162) to create a “weighted sample” that approximates the distribution of socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and sex in the U.S. Census. We compare associations between age and brain structure in this weighted sample to estimates from the original sample with no sample weights applied (i.e., unweighted). Compared to the unweighted sample, we observe earlier maturation of cortical and sub-cortical structures, and patterns of brain maturation that better reflect known developmental trajectories in the weighted sample. Our empirical demonstration of bias introduced by non-representative sampling in this neuroimaging cohort suggests that sample composition may influence understanding of fundamental neural processes.},

@article{Nohr18,
	abstract = {Longitudinal cohort studies can provide important evidence about preventable causes of disease, but the success relies heavily on the commitment of their participants, both at recruitment and during follow up. Initial participation rates have decreased in recent decades as have willingness to participate in subsequent follow ups. It is important to examine how such selection affects the validity of the results. In this article, we describe the conceptual framework for selection bias due to nonparticipation and loss to follow up in cohort studies, using both a traditional epidemiological approach and directed acyclic graphs. Methods to quantify selection bias are introduced together with analytical strategies to adjust for the bias including controlling for covariates associated with selection, inverse probability weighting and bias analysis. We use several studies conducted in the Danish National Birth Cohort as examples of how to quantify selection bias and also understand the underlying selection mechanisms. Although women who chose to participate in this cohort were typically of higher social status, healthier and with less disease than all those eligible for study, differential selection was modest and the influence of selection bias on several selected exposure–outcome associations was limited. These findings are reassuring and support enrolling a subset of motivated participants who would engage in long-term follow up rather than prioritize representativeness. Some of the presented methods are applicable even with limited data on nonparticipants and those lost to follow up, and can also be applied to other study designs such as case–control studies and surveys.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Local health authorities need small-area estimates for prevalence of chronic diseases and health behaviors for multiple purposes. We generated city-level and census-tract-level prevalence estimates of 27 measures for the 500 largest US cities.METHODS: To validate the methodology, we constructed multilevel logistic regressions to predict 10 selected health indicators among adults aged 18 years or older by using 2013 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data; we applied their predicted probabilities to census population data to generate city-level, neighborhood-level, and zip-code-level estimates for the city of Boston, Massachusetts.RESULTS: By comparing the predicted estimates with their corresponding direct estimates from a locally administered survey (Boston BRFSS 2010 and 2013), we found that our model-based estimates for most of the selected health indicators at the city level were close to the direct estimates from the local survey. We also found strong correlation between the model-based estimates and direct survey estimates at neighborhood and zip code levels for most indicators.CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that our model-based estimates are reliable and valid at the city level for certain health outcomes. Local health authorities can use the neighborhood-level estimates if high quality local health survey data are not otherwise available.},
