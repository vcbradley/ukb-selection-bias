## The UK Biobank

__UK Biobank__

* Largest ever prospective health study
* Includes genetic sequencing, blood tests, physical exams, health history questionnaire
* 500,000 participants aged 40-70 when recruited between 2006 and 2010

__UK Biobank imaging cohort__

* Subset of UKB participants recruited to undergo additional imaging exams

__Goal__: Study exposures and outcomes that affect aging populations


## Selection bias in the UK Biobank
```{r fig-1}
ggplot(weight_summary[level %in% c('Female', '01-White', '1', '01-Under 18k', '01-College plus/profesh', '01-Own outright','02-Own with mortgage') | var %in% c('03-Age Bucket', '11-Income')]) +
  geom_point(aes(x = as.numeric(as.character(pop_prop_weighted)), y = paste0(var, ': ',level), color = 'Population')) +
  geom_point(aes(x = as.numeric(as.character(samp_prop)), y = paste0(var, ': ',level), color = 'UKB Imaging cohort')) + 
  ggtitle("UK Population v. UKB Imaging cohort") +
  xlab("proportion of group") +
  ylab("")

```


## Why is this a problem?

For example,

* Y is an individual’s hippocampal volume
* X represents a subject’s socio-economic status (SES)
* Z represents the subject’s level of dementia 
* S is selection into the study

\center
```{r fig-2, out.width='40%'}
include_graphics('~/github/mini-project-1/presentation/selection-bias-ex'
                 , auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", FALSE)
                 , dpi = NULL)
```
\center

By conditioning on selection, if we know that someone is of low SES, they are less likely to show signs of dementia (than if we didn't know their SES)


## Recovering from selection bias

If we can re-write our outcome of interest \(\text{P}(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x})\) as

\(\text{P}(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x}) = \sum_\mathbf{z} \text{P}(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z}, S=1)\text{P}(\mathbf{z}\setminus\mathbf{z^T}|\mathbf{z^T}, S = 1)\text{P}(\mathbf{z^T})\)

then it's possible to recover from selection bias. 

* \(\mathbf{z}\) is a set of observed *auxiliary variables*
* \(\mathbf{z}^T\) is the subset of \(\mathbf{z}\) for which we have external, unbiased population data
* Key is that conditioning on \(\mathbf{z}\) makes the outcome of interest, \(Y\) conditionally independent of selection \(S\)

__Problem__: can only condition on a limited number of discrete variables before this breaks down

Methods for selection bias seek to solve this in different ways

## Methods

1. *Post-stratification*: adjust to the joint distribution of \(\mathbf{z}\) 
2. *Raking*: iteratively adjust the marginal distributions of elements in \(\mathbf{z}\)
3. *Calibration*: raking, but with continuous variables as well as discrete variables
4. *LASSO*: use a LASSO to select variables and interactions for raking
5. *Logit*: estimate the probability of selection directly

New method:

6. *BART + raking*: use a BART to estimate the probability of selection, then rake so key marginal distributions match those of the population


## Simulation Results

```{r fig-sim-results, out.width='100%'}
include_graphics('~/github/mini-project-1/simulation/results/sim_1_5000_old_v3/plots/mse_by_sample_size.png'
                 , auto_pdf = getOption("knitr.graphics.auto_pdf", FALSE)
                 , dpi = NULL)
```


## Application to UK Biobank
```{r fig-ukb-results}
ggplot(weight_summary[level %in% c('Female', '01-White', '1', '01-Under 18k', '01-College plus/profesh', '01-Own outright','02-Own with mortgage') | var %in% c('03-Age Bucket', '11-Income')]) +
  geom_point(aes(x = as.numeric(as.character(pop_prop_weighted)), y = paste0(var, ': ',level), color = 'Population')) +
  geom_point(aes(x = as.numeric(as.character(samp_prop)), y = paste0(var, ': ',level), color = 'UKB Imaging cohort')) +
geom_point(aes(x = as.numeric(as.character(bart_prop)), y = paste0(var, ': ',level), color = 'BART adjusted')) + 
  ggtitle("UK Population v. UKB Imaging cohort") +
  xlab("proportion of group") +
  ylab("")
```
